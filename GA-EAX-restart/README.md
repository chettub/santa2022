### Introduction
We modified GA-EAX [[Nagata, Y., & Kobayashi, S. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0506)] for this competition.
The code is mainly based on [GA-EAX-restart](https://github.com/senshineL/GA-EAX-restart), however we are assuming that the original code was based on the supplementary code of [Nagata, Y., & Kobayashi, S. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0506) as some of the variable names are in Japanese.
#### Update 2023/07/08
The original code seems to be [nagata-yuichi/GA-EAX](https://github.com/nagata-yuichi/GA-EAX).


### Differences from [GA-EAX-restart](https://github.com/senshineL/GA-EAX-restart)
We have midified [GA-EAX-restart](https://github.com/senshineL/GA-EAX-restart) for this competition to:
* change I/O for the competition
* add path dependant penalty
* allow restart conditions, initial stage, and number of runs to be specified
* allow high precision calculation (64 bit and 128 bit integer cost types)

See [1st place solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2022/discussion/379167) for detailed changes.
